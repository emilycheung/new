				<div class= "paragraph"><p>China is the world's third largest country, with an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers. It has a coastline of 18,000 kilometers and is bordered by 14 countries. The vast land expanses of China consists of plains, basins, plateaus, mountains and foothills. The highest step of the topography is made up by the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with an average height of over 4,000 meters, including the Kunlunshan range, Qilianshan range and Hengduan mountain chain. Lower mountains and foothills contain altitudes of over 500 meters. From the higher elevations in the west thousands of rivers drain the country; the most significant include the Yangtze (third longest river on the planet), and the Heilong (Amur), Mekong, Pearl and Yellow.

				<div class="Reviews-paragraph"><b>Sara Johnson, Brooklyn, NY</b><p>I booked a Shanghai Tour with my family for 8 days. The process was quite simple since the company took care of everything: the arrangement of the rooms, tickets, etc. The service was extraordinary. The vacation counselor Jamie was very informative and patient despite all the questions I had. I did not have to worry about the time and schedule for the specific events since all were laid out in time ranges. My family and I were both extremely sastified and could not have asked for a better vacation. When we plan for another vacation, I will definitely use this company.</p>

				<div class="Reviews-paragraph"><b>Thomas Liang, Staten Island, NY</b><p>My wife and I booked a Beijing tour for our summer vacation in 2017. Our tour guide, Simon was a friendly fellow with great knowledge about all the places he took us to as well as the culture/background behind the regions. He kept the large group organized and he was able to arrange places to eat which could accommodate everyone. I cannot recommend this company and Simon enough, my entire trip was truly fantastic. Everything that was promised was delivered. We will definitely book again for our next vacation.</p>

				<div class="Reviews-paragraph"><b>Sabrina Smith, Las Vegas, Nevada</b><p>We booked a Guangzhou tour and went a couple of months ago. If my family and I were to describe our experience in one word it would simply be "sensational". This was a trip that we will always remember because of the amazing service provided during the tour. They gave us a book of coupons along an itinerary of everyday's event. Nothing was sudden or unexpected since all the activities were planned out accordingly. I am the type of person who likes to have a plan, making this tour a perfect match for me. I highly recommend this tour for everyone! 5/5 Stars :))) </p>

				<div id="popup">1. What are some common items travelers bring with them? Travelers bring a small power strip - making it less of a hassle to share an outlet with a crowd. They also carry a sleeping pillow and blanket since it's definitely going to be one long flight. Have fun!
